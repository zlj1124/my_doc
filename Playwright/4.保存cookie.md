    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = browser.new_context()

    # Interact with login form
    page.get_by_label("Username or email address").fill("yoyo")
    page.get_by_label("Password").fill("*********")
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Sign in").click()
    # Continue with the test

    # 保存storage state 到指定的文件
    storage = context.storage_state(path="auth/state.json")

    # ---------------------
    context.close()
    browser.close()


with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

使用登录验证信息：

```
from playwright.sync_api import Playwright, sync_playwright, expect


def run(playwright: Playwright) -> None:
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    # 加载本地cookies，免登陆
    context = browser.new_context(storage_state="auth/state.json")
    
    # 打开页面继续操作
    page = context.new_page()
    page.goto('https://github.com/')
    page.pause()  # 打断点看是不是已经登录了

    context.close()
    browser.close()


with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)

```
## 获取cookies
#方法1
print(context.cookies())
#方法2
print(page.context.cookies())

 #添加cookies
