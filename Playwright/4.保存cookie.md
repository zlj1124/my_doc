from playwright.sync_api import Playwright, sync_playwright, expect


def run(playwright: Playwright) -> None:
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    # 加载本地cookies，免登陆
    context = browser.new_context(storage_state="auth/state.json")
    
    # 打开页面继续操作
    page = context.new_page()
    page.goto('https://github.com/')
    page.pause()  # 打断点看是不是已经登录了

    context.close()
    browser.close()


with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
